CASIA Iris Syn

CASIA-Iris-Syn contains 10,000 synthesized iris images of 1,000 classes. The iris textures of these images are synthesized automatically from a subset of CASIA-IrisV1 with the approach described in [1] (Fig. 10). Then the iris ring regions were embedded into the real iris images, which makes the artificial iris images more realistic. The intra-class variations introduced into the synthesized iris dataset include deformation, blurring, and rotation, which raise a challenge problem for iris feature representation and matching. We have demonstrated in [1] that the synthesized iris images are visually realistic and most subjects can not distinguish genuine and artificial iris images. More importantly, the performance results tested on the synthesized iris image database have similar statistical characteristics to genuine iris database. So users of CASIA-IrisV4 are encouraged to use CASIA-Iris-Syn for iris recognition research and any suggestions are welcome. If CASIA-Iris-Syn proves to be successful for most researchers of iris recognition, we will provide more and more synthesized iris images in the future.![http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/images/V4Fig_10.jpg]
